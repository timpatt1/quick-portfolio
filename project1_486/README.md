Document what your proposal is for the first project: pick a topic of your choice, find the appropriate data, perform necessary spatial analysis, produce appropriate outputs based on materials we've used in class. 

 
- What is the **topic**?
  Sea Level Rise in Annapolis.
  
- What are the **data** and where is the data obtained from (provide links too)?
   Sea level Rise and Data of Anne Arundel County [https://coast.noaa.gov/slrdata/] 
     [https://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/Inundation/SLR/SLRdata/MD/MD_West_slr_data_dist.zip] and [https://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/Inundation/SLR/SLRdata/MD/MD_West_dem.zip]
     
- Are there any necessary **transformations or subsets** you need to do to the data?
 I will need to transform the datas projection in order to create a 3 demensional map. 
 
- What is the **analysis** you'll be performing on your data sets?
  I would like to analyze sea level rise in Annapolis in the recent years since the flood wall was inccoperated at city dock. With that I will compare the data to years prior to its constrction in order to et an idea of how successful te project was. 
  
- What **outputs** will you be creating and how are they directly connected to the class?
  I would like to constuct a map that seperates the layers of sea level rise, buildins constuction, as well as breakin that data into years in order to compare the effects of recent constrcution in Annapolis.
