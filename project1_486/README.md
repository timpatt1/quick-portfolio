Document what your proposal is for the first project: pick a topic of your choice, find the appropriate data, perform necessary spatial analysis, produce appropriate outputs based on materials we've used in class. 

 
- What is the **topic**?
  Sea Level Rise in Annapolis.
  
- What are the **data** and where is the data obtained from (provide links too)?
   Sea level Rise and Data of Anne Arundel County [https://coast.noaa.gov/slrdata/] 
     [https://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/Inundation/SLR/SLRdata/MD/MD_West_slr_data_dist.zip] and [https://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/Inundation/SLR/SLRdata/MD/MD_West_dem.zip]
     
- Are there any necessary **transformations or subsets** you need to do to the data?
 I will need to transform the datas projection in order to create a 3 demensional map. 
 
- What is the **analysis** you'll be performing on your data sets?
  I would like to analyze sea level rise in Annapolis in the recent years since the flood wall was inccoperated at city dock. With that I will compare the data to years prior to its constrction in order to et an idea of how successful te project was. 
  
- What **outputs** will you be creating and how are they directly connected to the class?
  I would like to constuct a map that seperates the layers of sea level rise, buildins constuction, as well as breakin that data into years in order to compare the effects of recent constrcution in Annapolis. 


UPDATE: was not able to find building data for post 2013 (When city dock was improved) so am now focusing on the areas and buildings most effected by sea level rise.
