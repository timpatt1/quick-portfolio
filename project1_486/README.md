Document what your proposal is for the first project: pick a topic of your choice, find the appropriate data, perform necessary spatial analysis, produce appropriate outputs based on materials we've used in class. 

- What is the **topic**?
- What are the **data** and where is the data obtained from (provide links too)?
- Are there any necessary **transformations or subsets** you need to do to the data?
- What is the **analysis** you'll be performing on your data sets?
- What **outputs** will you be creating and how are they directly connected to the class?
